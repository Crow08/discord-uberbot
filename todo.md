### Known Bugs: ###

##### Error handling #####
- catch all promises and process accordingly.
- catch all fatal errors to prevent bot crash.
- Notify user every time, even after unsuccessful execution.
- Bot crashes, when it announces player and the queue is empty
	-recreate: Start bot, leave, join, leave, join

##### Strange behavior #####
- sometimes in playback no sound is played while stream seems to be active.
	- can be solved via voice reconnect of the bot.
	- hard to reproduce reliable.
- sometimes in stream does not end, when the song has ended playing.
	- can be solved via skip song.
	- hard to reproduce reliable.
- frequent channel switches crash playback of bot
	- must be because of the announce messages
	- .stop -> .p to fix it

##### Report all the Errors ####
- *`:x: | Error: input stream: No formats found with custom filter`* 
	- *-> (how to reproduce?)*
