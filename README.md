### Hosting ###

Works great with [heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (free).  
The settings and credentials can be set via heroku environment variables.  
We recommend to host the DB on an external server like [MongoDB Cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) (free).  
Add the mongoDB url, username and password to your setting.json
